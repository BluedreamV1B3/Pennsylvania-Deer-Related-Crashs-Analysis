Having come from Taiwan to pursue a master's degree in Philadelphia, my first day in Pennsylvania proved to be unsettling as I witnessed a tragic incident where a severely deformed deer lay lifeless by the roadside, covered in blood. In Taiwan, deer are cherished animals and are protected by the government, often found in the comforting confines of zoo enclosures. Motivated by this jarring experience, I am now determined to gather statistics on such occurrences in Pennsylvania and explore measures to safeguard both humans and deer.

## Summary 

* The number of deer-related crashes has continued to rise since 2007 and has remained between 5,500 and 5,800 per year since 2017. By 2021, deer-related crash accounts for 5% of all type of crash.

* The consequences of most deer-related accidents were property damage or minor injury, but there were still people seriously injured or even killed

* Big cities like Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and even Philadelphia, and their surrounding areas, have many deer-related crashes, far more than the countryside.

* Not sure whether the accident related to deer is caused by the fact that deer are more active at night (17:00 - 6:00) or because it is caused by the increase in traffic and people's rush during commuting time. I think it has something to do with both roles and there may have an interaction effect, further analysis is needed to confirm. 

* The difference in numbers between weekends and weekdays is not that big but there is a pattern that more deer-related crashes happened on weekends.

* More crashes happened from mid-October to November. This is because of the deer's mating season and deer are less aware of their surroundings and they jump in front of cars causing accidents.

* Hempfield Twp, Pittsburgh City, Pocono Twp, Tobyhanna Twp, and Cranberry Twp are the top five municipalities with the most deer-related crashes from 2007 to 2021. District 5 (Berks, Carbon, Lehigh, Monroe, Northampton, and Schuylkill Counties) in Pennsylvania have the most deer-related crashes from 2007 to 2021. 

* Higher speed limits are linked to a higher chance of deer-related crashes.

## Advisement

* Deer Awareness Campaigns: Given the continuous rise in deer-related crashes, it is essential for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to launch awareness campaigns targeted at both drivers and residents. These campaigns should educate drivers about the increased risk of encountering deer during specific times of the year and in certain areas. Residents should also be encouraged to take precautions to avoid deer collisions, such as reducing speed in deer-prone areas and reporting any sightings of deer near roadways.

* Focus on High-Risk Areas: The analysis shows that big cities and their surrounding areas have a higher frequency of deer-related crashes. It is crucial to focus road safety efforts on these areas, implementing measures like improved road signage, increased police presence, and the installation of wildlife crossings or fencing in areas with high deer populations.

* Nighttime Safety Measures: The data suggests that a significant number of deer-related crashes occur during nighttime hours. Implementing additional safety measures, such as better road lighting, reflective road markings, and educational campaigns reminding drivers to be cautious during low-light conditions, could help reduce these incidents.

* Weekend Patrols: While the difference in crash numbers between weekends and weekdays is not substantial, the observed pattern indicates that more deer-related crashes happen on weekends. Deploying additional patrols during weekends in areas prone to deer encounters could help mitigate accidents during these periods.

* Targeted Speed Limit Adjustments: The analysis reveals a correlation between higher speed limits and an increased likelihood of deer-related crashes. Consideration should be given to reevaluating speed limits in high-risk areas, especially where there is a known deer population, to reduce the risk of collisions and improve overall road safety.

* Wildlife Corridor Planning: Collaboration with environmental agencies and wildlife experts could help identify key wildlife corridors where deer frequently cross roads. By integrating this information into transportation planning, Pennsylvania can design and implement wildlife-friendly infrastructure, such as underpasses and overpasses, to reduce the risk of deer-vehicle collisions.

* Comprehensive Data Collection and Analysis: Further research and analysis are needed to investigate the interaction effects between deer behavior, traffic patterns, and commuter rush hours. Collecting more detailed data on deer movements and behavior, as well as traffic volume and congestion during specific timeframes, could provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of deer-related crashes.

* Public Reporting and Feedback System: Encouraging the public to report deer sightings near roadways and providing a platform for drivers to share their experiences with deer encounters can help raise awareness and contribute to data collection efforts.

By implementing these recommendations, Pennsylvania can take proactive steps to reduce deer-related crashes, enhance road safety, and protect both drivers and wildlife. Continual monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures will be essential in ensuring their success and making further adjustments as needed.
